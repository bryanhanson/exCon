## exCon

`exCon` is an `R` package under development.  `exCon` is an interactive tool to explore topographic-like data sets.  Such data sets take the form of a matrix in which the rows and columns provide location/frequency information, and the matrix elements contain altitude/response information.  Such data is found in cartography, 2D spectroscopy and chemometrics.

At this stage, we are still perfecting the `JavaScript` code.  There is an `R` interface, but we have not created the package infrastructure yet.  Use of `exCon` will be very simple: call the `R` function `exCon` with a matrix as the argument, and `R` will create an interactive web page showing the contoured data set along with slices from the original matrix parallel to each dimension.

### Authors

`exCon` was developed by Kristina Mulry and Bryan Hanson in the Spring of 2014, at DePauw University.
