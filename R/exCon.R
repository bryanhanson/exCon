##' Explore Contour Data Interactively
##'
##' This function computes contour lines from matrix data and displays them
##' in an interactive web page using the d3 javascript library.
##' 
##' @param M A matrix.
##'
##' @param x A vector of numeric values giving the locations of the grid defining
##' the matrix.  Must have length \code{nrow(M)}.
##'
##' @param y A vector of numeric values giving the locations of the grid defining
##' the matrix.  Must have length \code{ncol(M)}.
##'
##' @param nlevels  Integer.  The number of contour levels desired.  Ignored if \code{levels}
##' is given.
##'
##' @param levels  Numeric.  A vector of values (altitudes if you will) at which to
##' compute the contours.
##'
##' @param browser Character.  Something that will make sense to your OS.  Only
##' necessary if you want to overide your system specified browser as understood by
##' \code{R}.  See below for further details.
##'
##' @return None; side effect is an interactive web page.  The temporary directory
##' containing the files that drive the web page is written to the console in case
##' you wish to use those files.  This directory is deleted when you quit R.
##'
##' @section Details: The computation of the contour lines is handled by
##' \code{\link[grDevices]{contourLines}}.  The result here, however, is transposed so that the
##' output has the same orientation as the original matrix. This is necessary because
##' \code{\link[graphics]{contour}} tranposes its output: "Notice that
##' \code{contour} interprets the \code{z} matrix as a table of 
##' \code{f(x[i], y[j])} values, so that the x axis corresponds to row number
##' and the y axis to column number, with column 1 at the bottom, i.e. a 90 degree
##' counter-clockwise rotation of the conventional textual layout."
##' 
##' @section Interpretation:  The contour lines are an interpolation of the data
##' in the matrix.  The slices are the actual values in the matrix row or column
##' connected point-to-point.  Thus a maximum in a slice may not correspond to 
##' a peak in the contour plot.
##' 
##' @section Browser Choice: The browser is called by
##' \code{\link[utils]{browseURL}}, which
##' in turn uses \code{options("browser")}.  Exactly how this is handled
##' is OS dependent.
##'
##' @section RStudio Viewer: If browser is \code{NULL}, you are using RStudio, and a viewer is specified, this will be called.  You can stop this by with \code{options(viewer = NULL)}.
##'
##'
##' @section Browser Choice/Mac: On a Mac, the default browser is called
##' by \code{/bin/sh/open}
##' which in turn looks at which browser you have set in the system settings.  You can
##' override your default with
##' \code{browser = "/usr/bin/open -a 'Google Chrome'"} for example.
##' Testing shows that on a Mac, Safari and Chrome perform correctly,
##' but in Firefox the mouse cursor is slightly offset from the guides.  While it
##' doesn't look quite right, it works correctly (the guides determine which
##' slice is displayed).
##'
##' @section Browser Choice/Other Systems:  \code{exCon} has been tested
##' on a Windows 7
##' professional instance running in VirtualBox using Firefox and Chrome, and
##' runs correctly (Firefox has the same mouse position issue as mentioned above).
##'
##' @section Browser Choice & Performance:  You can check the performance of
##' your browser at peacekeeper.futuremark.com  The most relevant score for
##' exCon is the rendering category.  In limited testing, Chrome does the best.
##'
##' @section Performance Limits (YMMV): On a 4-year old MacBook Pro, with 8 Gb
##' RAM and an Intel Core i7 chip, a
##' 4000 x 4000 matrix with 5 contour levels 
##' requires about 30 seconds for R to create the contours.  The web page displayed
##' by
##' Chrome 38 appears to be about 85 Mb in size and the guide movements lag the mouse
##' movements quite a bit, but it is still usable.  Sometimes the page won't load.
##' The files on disk are about 159 Mb. Firefox 32 will load the 4K x 4K
##' matrix but performance is too sluggish. On the same computer, a
##' 5000 x 5000 matrix with 5 contour levels 
##'	causes Chrome to crash.  Testing on a newer Mac with 16 Gb RAMM shows that
##' the browser may be the limiting factor rather than the RAMM.
