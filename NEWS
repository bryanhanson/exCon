exCon is an interactive tool to explore topographic-like data
    sets.  Such data sets take the form of a matrix in which the rows and
    columns provide location/frequency information, and the matrix elements
    contain altitude/response information.  Such data is found in cartography,
    2D spectroscopy and chemometrics.  exCon creates an interactive web page
    showing the contoured data set along with slices from the original matrix
    parallel to each dimension. The page is written in d3/javascript.
