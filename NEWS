NEWS file for package exCon

Interactive tools to explore topographic-like data sets.  Such data sets take the form of a matrix in which the rows and columns provide location/frequency information, and the matrix elements contain altitude/response information.  Such data is found in cartography, 2D spectroscopy and chemometrics.  The functions in this package create interactive web pages showing the contoured data, possibly with slices from the original matrix parallel to each dimension. The interactive behavior is created using the D3.js JavaScript library by Mike Bostock.
